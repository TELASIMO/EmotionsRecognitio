# Emotion-recognition
The recognition of the set of emotions during a telephone conversation is a master project, we have adapted the recognition models to the field of Cybersecurity. 
It is about the approaches of the deep learning namely the LSTM and the CNN. To execute these models it is necessary to :
- install anaconda and the following libraries:
	*tensorflow
	*numpy
	*matplotlib
	*seaborn
	*keras
	*sklearn
The first cell allows us to import these libraries.
-Download the two datasets that is to say the training folder and the images folder. These are two datasets that we want to use to train and evaluate our models so the use is done in turn.
-Change the path to the first folder in the second cell, execute the code, send the results and start again for the second dataset.
